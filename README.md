**Pet Adoption Predictor**
This is a Flask-based web application that predicts the likelihood of a pet being adopted based on input features using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on structured data. The app uses an RBF kernel and includes preprocessing steps like one-hot encoding and standard scaling.

**Features**
1. Predicts adoption likelihood using SVM with RBF kernel
2. One-hot encoding of categorical features
3. Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
4. Model persistence with joblib
5. Web interface to interactively test predictions

**Machine Learning Model**
1. Model: Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
2. Kernel: RBF (Radial Basis Function)
3. Scaler: StandardScaler (sklearn)
4. Target: Binary classification (Adopted or Not Adopted)
